## Project Overview üê¢

This repository contains code and data used in our project:  

Genetic Consequences of Anthropogenic Pressures on Green Sea Turtles (*Chelonia mydas*) in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea, completde for our Biological Data Science Master's Capstone project at Arizona State University

We investigated how environmental pressures surch as climate change and pollution have affected the genetic health and variance of green sea turtles through the analysis of ddRAD-seq data.

Ecological Data/ contains the scripts used for processing environmental datasets.  
geneticData/ contains the scripts and data used in the genetic analysis.
